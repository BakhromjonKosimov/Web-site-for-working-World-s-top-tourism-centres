    <h4 style="color:darkcyan;">When you visit the Eternal City, prepare to cross a few must-see attractions – including the Colosseum, the Trevi Fountain and the Pantheon – off of your bucket list. Additional treasures, such as St. Peter's Basilica and the Sistine Chapel, can be found in nearby Vatican City. Escape the tourist crowds by taking a twilight stroll along the cobblestone streets of Trastevere, or head to Mercato Centrale Roma to sample local delicacies like gelato and pizza. Before leaving, peruse some of Rome's lesser-known museums, art galleries and boutiques.</h4>
