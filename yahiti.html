    <h4 style="color:darkcyan;">Travel to this island – the largest in French Polynesia – if you've been dreaming of a vacation spent lazing in a lavish overwater bungalow. Beyond the posh resorts, Tahiti boasts black sand beaches, a bustling capital and prime snorkeling and surfing conditions. If you're looking for more cultural experiences, check out some of the island's ancient temples or shop at its traditional covered markets. Luxurious five-star resorts abound here, but the easiest (and cheapest) way to experience this paradise is on a cruise.</h4>
