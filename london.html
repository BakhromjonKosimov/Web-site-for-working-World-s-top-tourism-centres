    <h4 style="color:darkcyan;">London is a world unto itself. The eclectic neighborhoods, which house a blend of historical landmarks and modern-day attractions, can keep you occupied for days. If it's your first time in London, save time for a visit to the Tower of London, Tate Modern, Buckingham Palace or the British Museum before sitting down to a classic afternoon tea. The best time to travel to London is during the warmer months, but be warned that this is also the busiest and most expensive time of year.</h4>
