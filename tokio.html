    <h4 style="color:darkcyan;">Simply setting foot in Japan's cosmopolitan capital is an experience within itself. A city known for its bustling streets adorned with flashing neon signs, Tokyo offers visitors a little bit of everything. Foodies won't be let down by the city's fresh sushi and hearty ramen. Budding photographers and adrenaline junkies will love taking in the sweeping panoramas from the top of the Tokyo Skytree. Shopaholics will find plenty of must-have designer products in Ginza. And for history buffs, Tokyo offers centuries-old temples and shrines to explore.</h4>
