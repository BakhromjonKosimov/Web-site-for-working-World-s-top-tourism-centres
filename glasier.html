    <h4 style="color:darkcyan;">Snow-capped peaks and azure lakes are just two reasons why Glacier National Park is one of the most-visited parks in the United States. There are more than 700 miles of hiking trails in this Montana park, plus 13 designated areas for camping. In winter, travelers can enjoy snowshoeing and skiing, while  summer is when vacationers can go swimming and whitewater rafting, among other popular activities. For those who'd rather admire their surroundings from their car, a scenic drive along Going-to-the-Sun Road can't be missed.</h4>
